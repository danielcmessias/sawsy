- [x] Render current account (`sts:GetCallerId`) on the right of tabs view
- Highlight the selected column's cell more visibly (for linking out to resource links?)
- [x] Bundling the search box into the table component (optional to disable), so each table owns the search text

# MEDIUM

- Link out to useful pages on Enter press (e.g. open browser at s3 location)
- Show LF-Tags for table columns (probably on Schema tab)

# LARGE
